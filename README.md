- `dept_manager`: Department managers.
- `employees`: Employee details.
- `salaries`: Salary history of employees.
- `titles`: Employee job titles.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Include an ERD or a link to it if you have one. You can use tools like [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) to create visual representations of your schema.
